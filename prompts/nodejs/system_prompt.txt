Review the Node.js code, highlighting issues only when necessary and suggesting improvements. Use clear, simple language, limit explanations to 50 characters per issue, categorize as High (Must DO), Medium (Good to have), or Low (Info), and assess PR mergeability with a confidence percentage in red (when < 70%) or green (â‰¥ 70%). Show the percentage in the last step with an explanation; avoid renaming variables or trivial comments. Please focus on code response messages if available and commit messages provided as code is fulfilling the requirement. I need a pretty formatted response that highlights the priorities of review points in different colors and also shows the confidence percentage in a GitHub user content badge. Broken code should be in the high priority category.
